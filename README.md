## Finding minimal traversals from hypergraphs

Up  to  now,  the  [SHD  algorithm][1]  implemented  by  Takeaki  Uno  is  a  standard  de  facto algorithm for finding minimal traversal. 

The aim of this project is to implement efficient algorithm dedicated to the extraction of the minimal traversal and which  beats the SHD algorithm whenever handling large datasets. 

The datasets to be considered for performance evaluation are available [here][2].
