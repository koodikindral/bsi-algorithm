## Finding minimal transversal from hypergraphs

Up  to  now,  the  [SHD  algorithm][1]  implemented  by  Takeaki  Uno  is  a  standard  de  facto algorithm for finding minimal transversals. 

The aim of this project is to implement efficient algorithm dedicated to the extraction of the minimal transversals and which  beats the SHD algorithm whenever handling large datasets. 

The datasets to be considered for performance evaluation are available [here][2].
